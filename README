This directory contains plots of each large (rho=2100) simulated chromosome generated for this study. The plots show the values of various summary statistics calculated in 21 adjacent windows (each with a genetic distance of rho=100) from each simulations. In each simulation, a selective sweep occurred in the middle of the central window. The "hard" directory contains simulated hard sweeps; the "soft" and "softRM" directories contain simulations of selection on standing variation and selection on recurrent adaptive mutations, respectively. "hard_geneconv_2100" contains simulations of a hard sweep occurring on a chromosome experiencing gene conversion events at a total rate (4Ng where g is the per-base pair initiation rate) of 2100. The "hard_old_tau_<t>" directories contain hard sweeps that completed 2N*t generations ago.

For each set of simulations, the windowed values of summary statistics in each individual replicate is plotted (files ending with "_<n>.png", where n is a number between 0 and 999). In addition, we have included the average values in each window across all 1000 simulations (file ending with "_averages.png"). Comparisons of these two image types reveal the extent to which patterns of variation flanking individual selective sweeps may differ from the expectation.
